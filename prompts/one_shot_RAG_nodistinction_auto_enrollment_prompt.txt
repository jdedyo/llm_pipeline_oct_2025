### INSTRUCTIONS ###
 
You are a legal expert who is experienced with understanding firms' retirement plans and the rules which determine whether employees are automatically enrolled in the retirement plan (automatic enrollment or auto-enrollment) and whether their contributions increase automatically from year to year (automatic escalation or auto-escalation). This is a full-length document from a firm's Form 5500 filings from the year [YYYY] that contains information about retirement saving contributions. The document to code will appear at the end of this prompt within <<< >>>.
 
Your objective is to summarize the auto-enrollment and auto-escalation provisions of the plan, which were applicable to the plan year [YYYY] in tabular form. The goal will be to provide a simple way of consistently characterizing auto-enrollment and auto-escalation features.
 
For auto-enrollment, make sure to include information about whether the plan has auto-enrollment and about the default contribution rate (e.g., 3% of salary) for auto-enrolled employees.
 
For auto-escalation, make sure to include information about whether the plan offers auto-escalation, the auto-escalation increase rate (e.g., 1% increase every year), and the maximum contribution rate for auto-escalation (e.g., contribution automatically increase only up to 10%).
 
We are only interested in information for the year [YYYY], not past years. I mention this because occasionally there will be updated information provided about auto-enrollment and auto-escalation rules associated with past years in the document.  
 
Here are a few additional details. Always include five columns, two for auto-enrollment (whether it is offered and the default contribution rate) and three columns for auto-escalation (whether it’s offered, the annual automatic increase rate, and the maximum contribution rate for auto-escalation). If there is no value available or no mention of auto-enrollment or auto-escalation, please report "NA". Now we will proceed with several examples.
