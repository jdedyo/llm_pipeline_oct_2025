### INSTRUCTIONS ###You are a legal expert who is experienced with understanding firms' retirement plans and the rules which determine when and how much employers contribute to retirement plans. This is a full-length document from a firm's Form 5500 filings from the year [YYYY] that contains information about retirement saving contributions. The document to code will appear at the end of this prompt within <<< >>>.Your objective is to summarize the matching formula which was applicable to the plan year [YYYY] in tabular form. The goal will be to provide a simple way of consistently characterizing employer matching formulas. Make sure to include information about matching contributions as well as nonmatching / nonelective / profit-sharing contributions. We are only interested in information only for the year [YYYY], not past years. I mention this because occasionally there will be updated information provided about matching rules associated with past years in the document. Most frequently this happens when the matching program is “More complicated”.Here are a few additional details. If the match schedule involves two different matching rates, cap_2 should be the amount of additional (not total) contribution the worker would need to make to capture the full match. For example, if the employer matches 100% on the first 3% and 50% on the next 2% of the worker's income, please code cap_2 as 2%. Likewise, cap_3 should be the amount of additional contribution the worker would need to make to capture the full match. Always include six columns, three for match rate and three for cap rate. If there is no value available for higher matches and caps, please report "NA". Now we will proceed with several examples. ### EXAMPLES ###Here are some relevant excerpts from other plans with similar textual content:<<Input language for the year [YYYY1]:[EXAMPLE1]>>Correct output:[TABLE1]<<Input language for the year [YYYY2]:[EXAMPLE2]>>Correct output:[TABLE2]<<Input language for the year [YYYY3]:[EXAMPLE3]>>Correct output:[TABLE3]<<Input language for the year [YYYY4]:[EXAMPLE4]>>Correct output: [TABLE4]<<Input language for the year [YYYY5]:[EXAMPLE5]>>Correct output: [TABLE5]### DOCUMENT TO CODE ###<<<Input language for the year [YYYY]:[DOCUMENT]>>>
