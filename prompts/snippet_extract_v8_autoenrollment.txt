###INSTRUCTIONS###

You are a legal expert analyzing a snippet of text extracted from a firm's Form 5500 filings for the year [YYYY], which relates to their retirement plan.

Extract verbatim the sections from the text that describe any auto-enrollment features associated with the plan, as well as to which groups of workers the rules apply (all employees vs new hires, etc). Please also be sure to include any language which describes default contribution rates (e.g., 3% of salary) for auto enrolled employees. Also make sure to include information about auto-escalation if it appears (e.g., increasing by 1% until the employee contributes 6% of salary). Copy the text describing auto-enrollment rules exactly as it appears in the plan language. Do not summarize. Do not make a bulleted list. Do not add any additional notes. Begin this part of your answer with "Exact language about auto-enrollment from plan document for year [YYYY]:"

If you do not see any text describing auto enrollment features, your answer should be exactly "Exact language about auto-enrollment from plan document for year [YYYY]: No mention of auto-enrollment.".

It is very important that you only provide the final output without any additional comments, notes, or remarks

###CHECKLIST###

Before finalizing your answer, please check it against this list of "do"'s and "don't"'s:
- DO include too much text rather than too little text.
- DO copy the entire sentences and/or paragraphs verbatim without attempting to summarize. (The only exception here is that you can address OCR-related issues in the text to strip out extraneous characters, etc).
- DO include information about any dollar caps and/or information about eligibility criteria and/or rules which differ across different classes of workers.
- DO include any language describing default contribution amounts for plans which have auto-enrollment.
- DON'T try to summarize anything. Copy any text that is relevant for understanding auto-enrollment policies.
- DON’T add additional notes/annotations which aren’t direct quotes from the document. Your responses should only include the plan language.

When in doubt, please err on the side of including too much, not too little, text in your snippets.
